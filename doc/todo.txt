Todo

+ when a toodo is longer than close to 60 characters,
  the complete all does not work on that lengthy todo!?
  (something with css?)
+ make title the id (?)
+ add tests for id (?) 

EDNetCore

+ replace preAdd with validation for title length in setTitle of Task: 
* SetAttributeAction does not call the specific set method.
  Thus, even if you write a validation in the specific method,
  it will not be used by EDNetCore. In future, the reflection will
  solve this problem.
* when SetAttributeAction with length validation for title added to Task,
  there was 'Null is not subtype of bool' errorr!?
